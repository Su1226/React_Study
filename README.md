# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


## STEP1 Install a build tool
The first step is to install a build tool vite. This build tools provide features to package and run source code, provide a development server for local development and a build command to deploy your app to a production server.


Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a fast and concise development environment for modern web projects.

```
npm create vite@latest
```

## STEP2 Setting Up a Project
1. Create a project name.
2. Select React as the framework to use.
3. Choose JavaScript + SWC as variable.
4. Navigate to the appropriate folder path.
5. Install as 'npm install'.
